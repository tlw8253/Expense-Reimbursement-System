# Expense-Reimbursement-System
# ERS Project built based on Revature Project 0
## Project 0 architecture modified and used in this Revature Project 1

# Develop an Expense Reimbursement System 

# Technologies:
##     Java 8
##     RESTful API
##     User and Reimbursement resources
##     Javalin, Logback / SLF4J, JUnit, Mockito, Hibernate, JDBC, MariaDB

# HTTP Endpoints 
##     Login, User, and Reimbursement enpoints

# General Requirements 
##     3 layered architecture
##     Controller (presentation) layer
##     Service (business logic) layer
##     Data Access layer
##     Utilize Mockito in order to mock DAO dependencies
##     Logging accomplished using Logback
##     Considerations for logging (Http Requests, Methods being executed, Exceptions)
##     Hibernate database modeling and connectivity
##     Hibernate HQL object orientated schema creation, data loads, record creation and updates
##     Utilize Hybrid for database modeling and connectivity
##     Utilizes the endpoint Controller, Service layer validation, and Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern
##     MariaDB (locally or ideally Amazon Web Services (AWS)) using Hibernate

# Extend concepts created in Project 0
##     Fully implements a GenericDAO<T> DAO model
##     Fully extends a base Data Transfer Object (DTO) model
